# A Tidy Transcriptomics introduction to RNA-Seq analyses

Authors:
    Dr. Maria Doyle^[maria.doyle@petermac.org],
    Dr. Stefano Mangiola^[mangiola.s@wehi.edu.au]

## Workshop Description

This workshop will present how to perform analysis of RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm. The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions. 

This can be achieved for RNA sequencing data with the [tidybulk](github.com/stemangiola/tidybulk), [tidyHeatmap](github.com/stemangiola/tidyHeatmap) and tidyverse packages. The package [tidybulk](github.com/stemangiola/tidybulk) provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation of ComplexHeatmap. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data.

The topics presented in this workshop will be

- Data exploration
- Data dimensionality reduction and clustering
- Differential gene expression analysis 
- Data visualisation

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of RStudio

# Workshop goals and objectives

In exploring and analysing RNA sequencing data, there are a number of key concepts, such as filtering, scaling, dimensionality reduction, hypothesis testing, clustering and visualisation, that need to be understood. These concepts can be intuitively explained to new users, however, (i) the use of a heterogeneous vocabulary and jargon by methodologies/algorithms/packages, (ii) the complexity of data wrangling, and (iii) the coding burden, impede effective learning of the statistics and biology underlying an informed RNA sequencing analysis. 

The tidytranscriptomics approach to RNA sequencing data analysis abstracts out the coding-related complexity and provides tools that use an intuitive and jargon-free vocabulary, enabling focus on the statistical and biological challenges.

## Learning goals

* To understand the key concepts and steps of bulk RNA sequencing data analysis
* To approach data representation and analysis though a tidy data paradigm, integrating tidyverse with tidybulk and tidyHeatmap.

## Learning objectives

* Recall the key concepts of RNA sequencing data analysis
* Apply the concepts to publicly available data
* Create plots that summarise the information content of the data and analysis results

# Introduction and data import
Measuring gene expression on a genome-wide scale has become common practice over the last two decades or so, with microarrays predominantly used pre-2008. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology in 2008, an increasing number of scientists use this technology to measure and understand changes in gene expression in often complex systems. As sequencing costs have decreased, using RNA-Seq to simultaneously measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes for multiple samples has never been easier. The cost of these experiments has now moved from generating the data to storing and analysing it.

There are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment. Analysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are aligned to a reference genome, then the number of reads mapped to each gene can be counted. This results in a table of counts, which is what we perform statistical analyses on in R. While mapping and counting are important and necessary tasks, today we will be starting from the count data and getting stuck into analysis.

First, let’s load all the packages we will need to analyse the data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(tidyHeatmap)
library(tidybulk)
library(plotly)
library(airway)
```

## Airway RNA-seq dataset
Here we will perform RNA-Seq analysis using the data from airway package. It has 8 samples, a sample treated with dex and an untreated control sample for 4 cell lines.

## Setting up the tables

The airway RNA-Seq data is stored as a RangedSummarizedExperiment object. We'll convert the SummarizedExperiment object into a tidybulk tibble, which is the tidyverse table format.

In this workshop we will be using the tidyverse pipe `%>%`. This 'pipes' the output from the command on the left into the command on the right/below. Using the pipe is not essential but it reduces the amount of code we need to write when we have multiple steps (as we'll see later). It also can make the steps clearer and easier to see.  For more details on the pipe see [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html).

```{r}
# load airay
data(airway)

# extract counts, convert the rownames into a column called GeneID 
counts_tt <-
	airway %>%
  tidybulk()
```

You can type the name of the object to view the first few lines and to see how many rows and columns it has. 

The `counts_annot` object contains information about genes and samples, the first column has the Ensembl gene identifier, the seconf column has the sample identifier and the third column has the gene transcription abundance expressed in number of reads aligning to the gene in each experimental sample. The remaining column include sample-wise information. The dex column tells us whether the samples are treated or untreated and the cell column tells us what cell line they are from.

```{r}
counts_tt
```

We can get the gene symbols for these Ensembl gene ids with tidybulk's ensembl_to_symbol. This works for human and mouse.

```{r}
counts_tt <- ensembl_to_symbol(counts_tt, feature)
counts_tt
```

We can shorten the sample names. We can remove the SRR1039 prefix that's present in all of them, as shorter names can fit better in some of the plots we will create. We can use `mutate()` together with `str_replace()` to remove the SRR1039 string from the sample column.

```{r}
counts_tt <- counts_tt %>% 
  mutate(sample=str_remove(sample, "SRR1039"))
```

All above operations can be linked, so no temporary variable have to be created. Now that we have our data in the format we want we will create a tidybulk object, that we can use to perform differential expression analysis with the tidybulk package.

```{r}
counts_tt <- 	
	airway %>%
  tidybulk() %>%
  ensembl_to_symbol(feature) %>%
  mutate(sample=str_remove(sample, "SRR1039"))
```

We can check how many counts we have for each sample by making a bar plot. This helps us see whether there are any major discrepancies between the samples more easily. We use weight= to sum up the counts for each sample.

```{r}
# make barplot of counts
ggplot(counts_tt, aes(x=sample, weight=counts, fill=dex)) + 
  geom_bar()+
	theme_bw()
```

We can also easily view by cell line (or any other variable that's a column in our dataset) simply by changing fill=.

```{r}
# make barplot of counts
ggplot(counts_tt, aes(x=sample, weight=counts, fill=cell)) + 
  geom_bar()+
	theme_bw()
```

The bar plots show us there are 15-30 million counts per sample.

# Filtering lowly expressed genes  
Genes with very low counts across all libraries provide little evidence for differential expression and they interfere with some of the statistical approximations that are used later in the pipeline. They also add to the multiple testing burden when estimating false discovery rates, reducing power to detect differentially expressed genes. These genes should be filtered out prior to further analysis.

With tidybulk, it is not really necessary to explicitly filter lowly transcribed genes, as all calculations (e.g., scaling, removal of unwanted variation, differential expression testing) are performed on abundantly transcribed genes; although in case of scaling, the scaling is applied back to all genes in the dataset.

However, to explicitly and/or temporarly drop them from the data set is useful for data visualisation. Tidybulk, uses the edgeR filterByExpr function described [here](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408). By default, this will keep genes with ~10 counts in a minimum number of samples, the number of the samples in the smallest group. In this dataset the smallest group size is 2 samples. tidybulk performs this filtering in the functions we will use `scale_abundance()` and `test_differential_abundance()` and we can explicitely apply it with `keep_abundant()`.

```{r}
# Take a look at the abundant genes
counts_tt %>% 
  keep_abundant(factor_of_interest = dex)
```

We can create density plots to view the distributions of the counts for the samples. This is also a quality check to see if the samples look similar and that none look majorly different. Note we need to log the counts which we can do by using `scale_x_log10()` We need to add a small offset (1) to the counts to avoid taking log of zero.

```{r}
# density plot after filtering 
counts_tt %>% 
	keep_abundant(factor_of_interest = dex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=counts + 1, group=sample, color=dex)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_log10() +
	theme_bw()
```

These samples all look pretty similar, none are majorly different.

We can count how many genes there are after filtering.
```{r}
counts_tt %>% 
	keep_abundant(factor_of_interest = dex) %>%
  summarise(num_genes = n_distinct(transcript))
```

#### Exercise
Adapt the code above to create a density plot of the counts before filtering lowly expressed genes. How does it compare it to the density plot above?
Count how many genes there were before filtering.

# Normalisation for sequencing depth and composition

TMM normalisation is performed to eliminate composition biases between libraries [@robinson2010tmm]. This generates a set of normalisation factors, where the product of these factors and the library sizes defines the effective library size. TMM normalisation (and most scaling normalisation methods) scale relative to one sample. In the tidybulk package the function `scale_abundance()` generates scaled counts, it will also perform the filtering.

```{r}
# Scaling counts for library size and composition bias
counts_scaled <- counts_tt %>% scale_abundance(factor_of_interest = dex)

# take a look
counts_scaled
```

After we run `scale_abundance()` we should see some columns have been added at the end. We have a column called `lowly_abundant` that indicates whether the gene has been filtered due to being lowly expressed. FALSE means the gene wasn’t filtered, TRUE means it was. The `counts_scaled` column contains the scaled counts.

We can now see the difference of abundance densities before and after scaling

```{r}
counts_scaled %>%
	
	pivot_longer(cols = contains("counts"), names_to = "source", values_to = "abundance") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=abundance + 1, group=sample, color=dex)) +
	geom_density() +
	facet_wrap(~source) +
	scale_x_log10() +
	theme_bw()
	
```

Another way to check the distributions of the counts in the samples is with box plots. We can add a line through the median with to help us see how similar (or not) the distributions are.

```{r}
# box plot after scaling
counts_scaled %>% 
  filter(!lowly_abundant) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sample, y=counts_scaled + 1, fill=dex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = median(counts_scaled + 1)), colour = 'red', show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```

These samples all look pretty similar, none are majorly different.

#### Exercise
Adapt the code above to create box plots of the counts before scaling. How do they compare to the box plots above?

# Quality control

## Multidimensional scaling plots

By far, one of the most important plots we make when we analyse RNA-Seq data are MDS plots. An MDS plot is a visualisation of a principal components analysis, which determines the greatest sources of variation in the data. A principal components analysis is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don't need to specify the groups. If your experiment is well controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data are the treatments/groups we are interested in. It is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers. We can use the `reduce_dimensions()` function to calculate the dimensions.


```{r}
# get MDS dimensions
counts_scal_MDS <-
  counts_scaled %>%
  reduce_dimensions(method="MDS", .dims = 2)

# take a look
counts_scal_MDS
```

For plotting, we can select just the dimensions for the samples.

```{r}
# get the dimensions with all metadata
MDSdims <-
	counts_scal_MDS %>%
	pivot_sample()

# take a look
MDSdims
```

Next we can plot the MDS dimensions as a scatterplot.

```{r}
# MDS plot
MDSdims %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, colour=dex)) + 
  geom_point() +
	theme_bw()
```


#### Exercise 

Colour the MDS plot i) by sample, ii) by cell line.
Try using `shape=` inside the aes() with the dex and/or cell variables.
Discuss what is the greatest source of variation in the data (i.e. what does dimension 1 represent)?


## Hierarchical clustering with heatmaps

An alternative to MDS for examining relationships between samples is using hierarchical clustering. Heatmaps are a nice visualisation to examine hierarchical clustering of your samples. tidybulk has a simple function we can use to extract the 500 most variable genes which we can then plot with tidyHeatmap.

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
counts_scal_MDS %>% 
	
	# extract 500 most variable genes
	keep_variable( .abundance = counts_scaled, top = 500) %>%
		
	# create heatmap
	heatmap(
	      .column = sample,
	      .row = transcript,
	      .value = counts_scaled,
	      annotation = c(dex, cell),
	      transform = log1p 
	  )
```

# Differential expression

Now that we are happy that the data looks good, we can continue to testing for differentially expressed genes. We will use the `test_differential_abundance()` from tidybulk which uses edgeR to perform the differential expression analysis. We give `test_differential_abundance()` our tidybulk counts object and a formula, specifying the column that contains our groups to be compared. If all our samples were from the same cell line we could use the formula `0 + dex`, however, each treated and untreated sample is from a different celline so we add the cell line as an additional factor `0 + dex + cell`. We also provide the names of the groups we want to compare/contrast to .contrasts (e.g. .contrasts = c("dextreat - dexuntreat")). `test_differential_abundance()` will perform the filtering of lowly expressed genes as described before. The results will be joined to our counts for every sample. If we just want a table of differentially expressed genes we can use pivot_transcript.
```{r warning=FALSE}
counts_de <- counts_tt %>%
    test_differential_abundance(
      .formula = ~ 0 + dex + cell,
      .contrasts = c("dextrt - dexuntrt"))

# take a look
counts_de %>%
	pivot_transcript()
```
Now we have columns with our logFC and FDR P values. There is also a column called significant that indicates if the gene has FDR < 0.05.


### Table of differentially expressed genes

We can write out our differentialy expressed genes to a file that can be loaded into e.g. Excel. `write_tsv()` will create a tab-separated file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# save results
counts_de %>% 
	pivot_transcript() %>%
	write_tsv( "de_results.tsv")
```


### Counting differentially expressed genes

We only have one contrast here so we can remove the suffix `_conditionbpreg - conditionblact` from the column headers, to make the names shorter to use in the rest of the commands here.

```{r}
counts_de_pretty <- 
	counts_de %>%
  rename_at(vars(contains("dex")),
            ~str_replace(., "_dextrt - dexuntrt", ""))
```


We can count how many differentially expressed genes there are using the significant column.

```{r}
counts_de_pretty %>% 
  filter(significant == TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(num_de = n_distinct(transcript))
```

#### Exercise
Count how many upregulated DE genes there are.  
Count how many downregulated DE genes there are.

### Extracting top differentially expressed genes

We can see the top genes by smallest P value. We'll take a look at the top 6.
```{r}
topgenes <- counts_de_pretty %>%
	pivot_transcript() %>%
  arrange(PValue) %>%
  head(6)

topgenes
```	

We can extract the symbols for these top genes with
```{r}
topgenes_symbols <- topgenes %>% pull(transcript)

# take a look
topgenes_symbols
```
	
# Plots after testing for DE

Let's make a few plots to make sure everything looks good and that we haven't made a mistake in the analysis. Genome-wide plots that are useful for checking are MA plots and volcano plots. We can also use stripcharts and heatmaps to visualise groups of genes.

### MA plots

MA plots enable us to visualise **amount** of expression (logCPM) versus logFC. Highly expressed genes are towards the right of the plot. We can also colour significant genes (e.g. genes with FDR < 0.05) 

```{r}
# maplot, minimal
counts_de_pretty %>%
  pivot_transcript() %>%
  filter(!lowly_abundant) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=logCPM, y=-logFC, colour=significant)) +
  geom_point()+
	theme_bw()
```

A more informative plot, integrating some of the packages in tidyverse.

```{r warning=FALSE}
counts_de_pretty %>%
    pivot_transcript() %>%

    # Subset data
		filter(!lowly_abundant) %>%
    mutate(significant = FDR<0.05 & abs(logFC) >=2) %>%
    mutate(transcript = ifelse(abs(logFC) >=5, as.character(transcript), "")) %>%

    # Plot
    ggplot(aes(x = logCPM, y = logFC, label=transcript)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = significant, size = significant, alpha=significant)) +
    geom_text_repel() +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "#e11f28")) +
    scale_size_discrete(range = c(0, 2)) +
		theme_bw()
```

### Volcano plots

Volcano plots enable us to visualise **significance** of expression (P value) versus logFC. Highly significant genes are towards the top of the plot. We can also colour significant genes (e.g. genes with FDR < 0.05) 

```{r}
# volcanoplot, minimal
counts_de_pretty %>%
  filter(!lowly_abundant) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=logFC, y=-log10(PValue), colour=significant)) +
  geom_point() +
	theme_bw()
```

A more informative plot, integrating some of the packages in tidyverse.

```{r warning=FALSE}
counts_de_pretty %>%
    pivot_transcript() %>%

    # Subset data
		filter(!lowly_abundant) %>%
    mutate(significant = FDR<0.05 & abs(logFC) >=2) %>%
    mutate(transcript = ifelse(transcript %in% topgenes_symbols, as.character(transcript), "")) %>%

    # Plot
    ggplot(aes(x = logFC, y = -log10(PValue), label=transcript)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = significant, size = significant, alpha=significant)) +
    geom_text_repel() +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "#e11f28")) +
    scale_size_discrete(range = c(0, 2)) +
    xlim(c(-10,10)) +
		theme_bw()
```

### Stripcharts

In addition to the genome-wide plots already discussed, it is recommended to have a look at the expression levels of the individual samples for the genes of interest, before following up on the DE genes with further lab work. We can use stripcharts to do this. These will help show if expression is consistent amongst replicates in the groups.

With stripcharts we can see if replicates tend to group together and how the expression compares to the other groups. We'll also add a box plot to show the distribution.


```{r}
counts_scaled %>%
	
	# extract counts for top DE genes
	filter(transcript %in% topgenes_symbols) %>%
	
	# make stripchart
	ggplot(aes(x = dex, y = counts_scaled + 1, fill = dex)) +
	geom_boxplot() +
	geom_jitter() +
	facet_wrap(~transcript) +
	scale_y_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```

### Interactive Plots

A really nice feature of using tidyverse and ggplot2 is that we can make interactive plots quite easily using the plotly package. This can be very useful for exploring what genes or samples are in the plots. To make interactive plots we first save our ggplot2 object, for example as "p". We can add label= into the aes() if we want other variables, such as the sample name to be visible when we hover over the plot.

```{r}
p <- counts_scaled %>%
	
	# extract counts for top DE genes
	filter(transcript %in% topgenes_symbols) %>%
	
  # make stripchart
	ggplot(aes(x = dex, y = counts_scaled + 1, fill = dex, label = sample)) +
	geom_boxplot() +
	geom_jitter() +
	facet_wrap(~transcript) +
	scale_y_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```

Then we simply give our plot, p, to the ggplotly function. We can also specify which parameters from the aes() we want to show up when we hover over the plot with tooltip=.

```{r}
ggplotly(p, tooltip = c("label", "y"))
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Key Points
- RNA-Seq data can be analysed in a 'tidy' way using the packages tidyverse, tidybulk and tidyHeatmap
- Key steps in an RNA-Seq analysis are filtering lowly expressed genes, normalisation for sequencing depth and composition, and testing for differential expression
- MDS plots are very important for examining the quality of the data
- Other useful plots for assessing RNA-Seq data are bar plots, density plots, box plots, MA plots, volcano plots, stripcharts and heatmaps. These can all be made in a 'tidy' way.
