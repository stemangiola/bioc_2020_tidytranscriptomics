## Acknowledgements
This material is adapted from an R for RNA-Seq workshop first run [here](http://combine-australia.github.io/2016-05-11-RNAseq/).

## Prerequisites
This course assumes some basic familiarity with RStudio and tidyverse, for example, the content covered [here](https://mblue9.github.io/r-intro-biologists/intro_r_biologists.html).
  
# Tidy Transcriptomics course
  
This course has been designed to introduce biologists to R for RNA-Seq analysis. The focus here is on using tidyverse to analyse RNA-Seq data, as we believe this is a productive and engaging way to learn R for RNA-Seq analysis. In this course we will use some new packages, [**tidybulk**]([https://github.com/stemangiola/tidybulk) and [**tidyHeatmap**](https://github.com/stemangiola/tidyHeatmap). These packages provide a friendly tidyverse-style way to perform analysis of RNA-Seq data.

# Setup

## Data files

Data files are available from the data folder in GitHub [here](https://github.com/mblue9/r-intro-biologists-rnaseq). You should download the files listed below and place them into a folder called `data` in your working directory.

Data files:

* GSE60450_GeneLevel_Raw_data.csv
* GSE60450_filtered_metadata.csv

# Overview
 
* Reading in tables of counts and metadata
* Formatting the data
* Filtering lowly expressed genes
* Scaling of counts
* Quality control plots
* Differential expression analysis
* Visualisation (Heatmaps, MA plot, Volcano plot)


# Introduction and data import
Measuring gene expression on a genome-wide scale has become common practice over the last two decades or so, with microarrays predominantly used pre-2008. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology in 2008, an increasing number of scientists use this technology to measure and understand changes in gene expression in often complex systems. As sequencing costs have decreased, using RNA-Seq to simultaneously measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes for multiple samples has never been easier. The cost of these experiments has now moved from generating the data to storing and analysing it.

There are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment. Analysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are aligned to a reference genome, then the number of reads mapped to each gene can be counted. This results in a table of counts, which is what we perform statistical analyses on in R. While mapping and counting are important and necessary tasks, today we will be starting from the count data and getting stuck into analysis.

First, let’s load all the packages we will need to analyse the data.

```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(utils)
library(stats)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(tidyHeatmap)
library(tidybulk)

```

## GREIN repository of RNA-Seq datasets
In this tutorial, we will learn some R through creating plots to visualise data from an RNA-Seq experiment. RNA-Seq counts file can be obtained from the [GREIN platform](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43935-8). GREIN stands for GEO RNA-Seq Experiments Interactive Navigator and provides >6,500 published datasets from GEO that have been uniformly processed. It is available at http://www.ilincs.org/apps/grein/. You can search for a dataset of interest using the GEO code. We obtained the dataset used here using the code GSE60450. GREIN provide QC metrics for the RNA-Seq datasets and both raw and normalised counts. We will use the raw counts here. Generally, the higher the number of counts the more the gene is expressed.

## Mouse mammary gland dataset
Here we will perform RNA-Seq analysis using data from a breast cancer research study, from the paper by [Fu et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472), GEO code GSE60450. This study examined gene expression in basal and luminal cells from mice at different stages of mammary gland development (virgin, pregnant and lactating). There are 2 samples per group and 6 groups, 12 samples in total.

![](images/mouse_exp.png)

## Reading in the data


Let's take a look at the data. You can type the name of the object to view the first few lines and to see how many rows and columns it has.

```{r}
counts = tidytranscriptomics::counts

counts

```

```{r}

sampleinfo = tidytranscriptomics::sampleinfo

sampleinfo
```
The `counts` object contains information about genes (one gene per row), the first column has the Ensembl gene id, the second has the gene symbol and the remaining columns contain information about the number of reads aligning to the gene in each experimental sample. Note the gene counts here are not integers as they're estimated counts from salmon (see here: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/101156/). There are two replicates for each cell type and time point (detailed sample info can be found in file "GSE60450_series_matrix.txt" from the [GEO website](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60450)). The `sampleinfo` metadata file contains basic information about the samples that we will need for the analysis today.

First we will convert the counts into long format (tidy format), similar to what we did in the Intro to R session.
```{r}
# convert to tidy format
counts_long <- 
	pivot_longer(counts, cols = starts_with("GSM"), names_to = "sample", values_to = "count") 

# take a look
counts_long
```

We will next extract just the columns we need, sample, gene_symbol, count. To do this we will use the tidyverse pipe `%>%`. This 'pipes' the output from the command on the left into the command on the right/below. Using the pipe is not essential but it reduces the amount of code we need to write when we have multiple steps (as we'll see later). It also can make the steps clearer and easier to see.  For more details on the pipe see [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html).

```{r}
# using pipe
counts_long_sel <- counts_long %>% 
  select(sample, gene_symbol, count, X1)

# take a look 
counts_long_sel
```

Take a look at the sampleinfo file. The first column "X1" contains the sample ids, the second "characteristics" contains the specific group the sample belongs to (e.g. mammary gland, luminal cells, virgin), the third column "immunophenotype" contains just the cell type (luminal or basal) and the fourth column "developmental stage" contains just the stage (virgin, pregnant or lactating).

```{r}
sampleinfo
```

We want to compare the groups in the "characteristics" column however the names are quite long so, similar to what we did in the Intro to R session, we'll make a column containing shorter group names.


```{r}
# make column called condition with shorter group names
sampleinfo_formatted <-
	mutate(sampleinfo, condition = case_when(                  
				str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*virgin") ~  "bvirg",
        str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*preg")  ~  "bpreg",
        str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*lact")  ~  "blact",
        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*virgin")  ~  "lvirg",
        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*preg")  ~  "lpreg",
        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*lact")  ~  "llact"
    ))

sampleinfo_formatted
```

Now we have our counts matrix in the long format we will join it to our sampleinfo so we have information on the samples, what groups they belong to. This is similar to what we did in the Intro to R session.

```{r}
counts_annot <- full_join(counts_long_sel, sampleinfo_formatted, by = c("sample" = "X1"))

# take a look
counts_annot
```

We can shorten the sample names. We can remove the GSM1480 prefix that's present in all of them as shorter names can fit better in some of the plots we will create. We can use `mutate()` together with `str_replace()` to remove the GSM1480 string from the sample column.

```{r}
counts_annot_pretty <- counts_annot %>% 
  mutate(sample=str_remove(sample, "GSM1480"))
```

All above operations can be linked, so no temporary variable have to be created

```{r}
counts_annot_pretty = 
	
	# Count data frame
	counts %>%
		pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("GSM"), names_to = "sample", values_to = "count") %>%
		select(sample, gene_symbol, count, X1) %>%
		full_join(
			
			# Sample info data frame
			sampleinfo %>%
				mutate(condition = case_when(                  
					str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*virgin") ~  "bvirg",
	        str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*preg")  ~  "bpreg",
	        str_detect(characteristics, "basal.*lact")  ~  "blact",
	        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*virgin")  ~  "lvirg",
	        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*preg")  ~  "lpreg",
	        str_detect(characteristics, "luminal.*lact")  ~  "llact"
	    )),
			by = c("sample" = "X1")
		) %>%
	
	# Shorten sample names
  mutate(sample=str_remove(sample, "GSM1480"))

```




Now that we have our data in the format we want we will create a tidybulk object, that we can use to perform differential expression analysis with the tidybulk package. For this we need to specify our counts object and the names of the columns that contain our sample ids, our gene identifiers and our counts. Any other columns in the counts object e.g. our Ensembl gene id "X1" column will remain at the end.
```{r}
#create a 'tt' object
counts_tt <- tidybulk(counts_annot_pretty, sample, gene_symbol, count)

# take a look
counts_tt
```
Some gene symbols are not unique, they map to more than one gene id. We need to remove this redundancy and we can do that with tidybulk function `aggregate_duplicates()`. By default it will aggregate duplicate gene symbols summing their counts. 

```{r}
# get rid of duplicated gene symbols
counts_aggr <- aggregate_duplicates(counts_tt)
```

We can check how many counts we have for each sample by making a bar plot. This helps us see whether there are any major discrepancies between the samples more easily.

```{r}
# make barplot of counts
ggplot(counts_aggr, aes(x=sample, weight=count, fill=condition)) + 
  geom_bar()+
	theme_bw()
```

The bar plots show us there are ~20 million counts per sample.

# Filtering lowly expressed genes  
Genes with very low counts across all libraries provide little evidence for differential expression and they interfere with some of the statistical approximations that are used later in the pipeline. They also add to the multiple testing burden when estimating false discovery rates, reducing power to detect differentially expressed genes. These genes should be filtered out prior to further analysis.

tidybulk can automatically filter out lowly expressed genes. It uses the edgeR filterByExpr function described [here](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408). This will keep genes with ~10 counts in a minimum number of samples, the number of the samples in the smallest group. In this dataset the smallest group size is 2 samples. tidybulk performs this filtering in the functions we will use `scale_abundance()` and `test_differential_abundance()` and we can take a look at it with `keep_abundant()`.

```{r}
# Filtering out lowly abundant genes 
counts_filt <- counts_aggr %>% 
  keep_abundant(factor_of_interest = condition)

# take a look
counts_filt
```

We can create density plots to view the distributions of the counts for the samples. This is also a quality check to see if the samples look similar and that none look majorly different. Note we need to log the counts which we can do by using `scale_x_log10()` We need to add a small offset (1) to the counts to avoid taking log of zero.

```{r}
# density plot after filtering 
counts_filt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=count + 1, group=sample, color=condition)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```
These samples all look pretty similar, none are majorly different.

We can count how many genes there are after filtering.
```{r}
counts_filt %>% 
  select(gene_symbol) %>% 
  n_distinct()
```

#### Exercise
Adapt the code above to create a density plot of the counts before filtering lowly expressed genes. How does it compare it to the density plot above?
Count how many genes there were before filtering.

# Normalisation for sequencing depth and composition

TMM normalisation is performed to eliminate composition biases between libraries [@robinson2010tmm]. This generates a set of normalisation factors, where the product of these factors and the library sizes defines the effective library size. TMM normalisation (and most scaling normalisation methods) scale relative to one sample. In the tidybulk package the function `scale_abundance()` generates scaled counts, it will also perform the filtering.

```{r}
# Scaling counts for library size and composition bias
counts_scaled <- counts_filt %>% scale_abundance(factor_of_interest = condition)

# take a look
counts_scaled
```

After we run `scale_abundance()` we should see some columns have been added at the end. We have a column called `lowly_abundant` that indicates whether the gene has been filtered due to being lowly expressed. FALSE means the gene wasn’t filtered, TRUE means it was. The `count_scaled` column contains the scaled counts.

We can also create box plots to check the distributions of the counts in the samples. We can add a line through the median with to help us see how similar (or not) the distributions are.

```{r}
# box plot after scaling
counts_scaled %>% 
  filter(lowly_abundant == FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sample, y=count_scaled + 1, fill=condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = median(count_scaled + 1), colour = 'red')) +
  scale_y_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```
These samples all look pretty similar, none are majorly different.

#### Exercise
Adapt the code above to create box plots of the counts before scaling. How do they compare to the box plots above?

# Quality control

## Multidimensional scaling plots

By far, one of the most important plots we make when we analyse RNA-Seq data are MDS plots. An MDS plot is a visualisation of a principal components analysis, which determines the greatest sources of variation in the data. A principal components analysis is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don't need to specify the groups. If your experiment is well controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data are the treatments/groups we are interested in. It is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers. We can use the `reduce_dimensions()` function to calculate the dimensions.


```{r}
# get MDS dimensions
counts_scal_MDS <-
  counts_scaled %>%
  reduce_dimensions(method="MDS", .dims = 2)

# take a look
counts_scal_MDS
```

Then we can select just the dimensions for the samples.

```{r}
# get the dimensions with all metadata
MDSdims <-
	counts_scal_MDS %>%
	pivot_sample()

# take a look
MDSdims
```

Next we can plot the MDS dimensions as a scatterplot. We'll colour by the conditions to see if the replicates group together.

```{r}
# MDS plot
MDSdims %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, colour=condition)) + 
  geom_point()+
	theme_bw()
```


#### Exercise 
Colour the MDS plot with different metadata variables e.g. immunophenotype. 
Try using `shape=` inside the aes(). You can use ?geom_point to check the help page.
Discuss what is the greatest source of variation in the data (i.e. what does dimension 1 represent)? What is the second greatest source of variation in the data?


Demo more MDS plots (sample swap, batch effects)

## Hierarchical clustering with heatmaps

An alternative to MDS for examining relationships between samples is using hierarchical clustering. Heatmaps are a nice visualisation to examine hierarchical clustering of your samples. tidybulk has a simple function we can use to extract the 500 most variable genes which we can then plot with tidyHeatmap.

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
counts_scal_MDS %>% 
	
	# extract 500 most variable genes
	keep_variable(top = 500) %>%
		
	# create heatmap
	heatmap(
	      .horizontal = sample,
	      .vertical = gene_symbol,
	      .abundance = count_scaled,
	      annotation = c(immunophenotype, `developmental stage`),
	      transform = log1p
	  )
```

# Differential expression

Now that we are happy that the data looks good, we can continue to testing for differentially expressed genes. We will use the `test_differential_abundance()` from tidybulk which uses edgeR to perform the differential expression analysis. We give `test_differential_abundance()` our tidybulk counts object and a formula, 
specifying the column that contains our groups to be compared e.g. `0 + condition`. We can also provide the names of the groups we want to compare/contrast to .contrasts (e.g. .contrasts = c("conditionbpreg - conditionblact")). `test_differential_abundance()` will also perform the filtering of lowly expressed genes as described before. We will use `action="get"` rather than the default tidybulk of `action="add"`, as we don't want to join the result to our counts for every sample. We just want a table of differentially expressed genes for the specified contrast. 
```{r}
counts_de <- counts_scal_MDS %>%
    test_differential_abundance(
      .formula = ~ 0 + condition,
      .contrasts = c("conditionbpreg - conditionblact")
     )

# take a look
counts_de %>%
	pivot_transcript()
```
Now we have columns with our logFC and FDR P values. There is also a column called significant that indicates if the gene has FDR < 0.05.

#### Exercise
Perform differential expression for lpreg vs llact. Don't save over `counts.de`, save as `counts.de2`.

Perform for 2 contrasts, bpreg vs blact and lpreg vs llact at the same time. Don't save over `counts.de`, save as `counts.de3`.

### Table of differentially expressed genes

We can write out our differentialy expressed genes to a file that can be loaded into e.g. Excel. `write_tsv()` will create a tab-separated file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# save results
counts_de %>% 
	pivot_transcript() %>%
	write_tsv( "de_results_bpreg_vs_blact.tsv")
```

We only have one contrast here so we can remove the suffix `_conditionbpreg - conditionblact` from the column headers, to make the names shorter to use in the rest of the commands here.

```{r}
counts_de_pretty <- 
	counts_de %>%
  rename_at(vars(contains("condition")),
            ~str_replace(., "_conditionbpreg - conditionblact", ""))
```

### Counting differentially expressed genes

We can count how many differentially expressed genes there are using the significant column.

```{r}
counts_de_pretty %>% 
  filter(significant == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(symbol)
```

#### Exercise
Count how many upregulated DE genes there are.  
Count how many downregulated DE genes there are.

### Extracting top differentially expressed genes

We can get the top genes by P value with
```{r}
counts_de_pretty %>%
	pivot_transcript() %>%
	filter(significant == TRUE) %>%
	arrange(PValue) %>%
	head(6)
```	

We can extract the symbols for these top genes with
```{r}
topgenes <- 
	counts_de_pretty %>%
	pivot_transcript() %>%
	filter(significant == TRUE) %>%
	arrange(PValue) %>%
	head(6) %>%
  pull(gene_symbol)
```
	
# Plots after testing for DE

Let's make a few plots to make sure everything looks good and that we haven't made a mistake in the analysis. Genome-wide plots that are useful for checking are MA plots and volcano plots. We can also use stripcharts and heatmaps to visualise groups of genes.

### MA plots

MA plots enable us to visualise **amount** of expression (logCPM) versus logFC. Highly expressed genes are towards the right of the plot. We can also colour significant genes (e.g. genes with FDR < 0.05) 

```{r}
# maplot, minimal
counts_de_pretty %>%
  filter(lowly_abundant == FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=logCPM, y=-logFC, colour=significant)) +
  geom_point()+
	theme_bw()
```

A more informative plot, integrating some of the packages in tidyverse

```{r}
counts_de_pretty %>%
    pivot_transcript() %>%

    # Subset data
    mutate(significant = FDR<0.05 & abs(logFC) >=2) %>%
    mutate(gene_symbol = ifelse(abs(logFC) >=7, as.character(gene_symbol), NA)) %>%

    # Plot
    ggplot(aes(x = logCPM, y = logFC, label=gene_symbol)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = significant, size = significant, alpha=significant)) +
    geom_text_repel() +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "#e11f28")) +
    scale_size_discrete(range = c(0, 2)) +
		theme_bw()


```

### Volcano plots

Volcano plots enable us to visualise **significance** of expression (logCPM) versus logFC. Highly significant genes are towards the top of the plot. We can also colour significant genes (e.g. genes with FDR < 0.05) 

```{r}
# volcanoplot, minimal
counts_de_pretty %>%
  filter(lowly_abundant == FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=logFC, y=-log10(PValue), colour=significant)) +
  geom_point() +
	theme_bw()
```
To see how to make more complicated volcano plots, including how to label genes in the plot, see the volcano plot tutorial [here](https://pmacdasci.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse/volcanoplot.html). More complicated MA plots could also be made in a similar way.

### Stripcharts

In addition to the genome-wide plots already discussed, it is recommended to have a look at the expression levels of the individual samples for the genes of interest, before following up on the DE genes with further lab work. We can use stripcharts and heatmaps to do this. These will help show if expression is consistent amongst replicates in the groups.

With stripcharts we can see if replicates tend to group together and how the expression compares to the other groups. 


```{r}
counts_de_pretty %>%
	
	# extract counts for top DE genes
	filter(gene_symbol %in% topgenes) %>%
	
	# make stripchart
	ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = count_scaled + 1, colour = condition)) +
	geom_jitter() +
	facet_wrap(~gene_symbol) +
	scale_y_log10()+
	theme_bw()
```

### Heatmaps

We can create heatmaps for the most differentially expressed genes. For example we could select the genes with FDR < 0.05 and a logFC change of 4 and make a heatmap of those.

Then we can create the heatmap selecting genes by applying filters for e.g. FDR and logFC.

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
counts_de_pretty %>%
  filter(FDR < 0.05 & abs(logFC) > 4) %>%
  heatmap(
        .horizontal = sample,
        .vertical = gene_symbol,
        .abundance = count_scaled,
        annotation = c(immunophenotype, `developmental stage`),
        log_transform = TRUE
    )
```

# Reproducibility 
Record package and version information with `sessionInfo()`

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
